What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

     A .git directory/folder will be created.  The command is "git init".

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

     Staging area is a place where temporarily changes are stored and these changes are to be applied to the repository when the next commit is performed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

     Do git add the set of files involved in a logical change, which place the set of files in the staging area.  Then do git commit to place those changed files to the respository.
